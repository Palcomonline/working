If you are a normal to average internet user who is aware of the things happening around it, then you have probably come across the term SEO or Search Engine Optimization. Now this might just sound like a common term for you, but do you really know the definition of it?

What is search engine optimization and how do you use it? SEO is a technique that is being used and practiced specifically by those who aim to rank up their websites. When you are looking for something at any search engine such as Google, what you do is type in the keywords or topic that you are looking for, right?

Then you are being led to several matches although it is quite noticeable as to how certain sites are at the uppermost corner of the search.

Did you ever wonder why this happens? How do these sites manage to be on top of the ranking? The reason behind it is the magic of SEO. 

It is a strategy used in Internet Marketing by optimizing a website. But first, you will need to have a definite plan on how you are going to utilize this technique.

Basically, SEO falls into two wide categories which are Black Hat and White Hat SEO. Black Hat SEO uses tricky ways to generate more traffic to a certain website.

This can be done in sneaky ways such as stuffing keywords and paid linking. If you are after an honest to goodness technique, then the White Hat SEO is for you.

This can be achieved by using clean and exact methods that will genuinely draw interest from readers. Some of these methods include adding photos and videos to your posts.

Improving the quality of your content is also another way to gain more viewers. Although the sneaky techniques may be successful at ranking higher, search engines are now becoming less lenient about this so it is always better to do the right thing when it comes to optimizing your site.
