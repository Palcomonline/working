Having a New Year's resolution is a great way to kick off the year but too many people jump off the boat quick.

Sometimes they will last a month, some will even make it to April or May but a majority of people will certainly quit before they see any results.

The problem is that the drive to succeed simply disappears after they start to feel like there are no results.

You will need to be patient but if you take the steps needed before actually making the resolutions, you will have a better chance at succeeding.

Be Realistic

This is something that people have trouble with as they tend to dream too big and make it nearly impossible to be able to achieve it.

Sometimes it is better to dream smaller and then to surprise yourself because you will feel like it is "too easy." It is tough to dream too big when you are not sure if it is realistic to make that goal.

Be realistic with your resolution and you will have a better chance at being able to achieve your resolutions.

Tell A Friend 

A good way to feel the drive to succeed is to tell a friend about your resolution. You will need to make yourself accountable for your actions and so it is crucial that you focus on finding a friend that you can trust.

This friend can also help challenge and motivate you through the process and so you will need to find a friend that you can be open to.

These are two simple things that you can do so that you will have a better chance at finally going through with your New Year's resolutions.

As long as you stay realistic and you tell a friend, you will surely see more success this coming year.
