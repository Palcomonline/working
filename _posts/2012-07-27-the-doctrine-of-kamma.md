<em>Kamma</em> is a Pali word. A better known equivalent of kamma is <em>karma</em>. Why we are using kamma, not karma, even though on the outset both literally mean action. The word karma comes from Sanskrit, the world’s most ancient language. This simply means an action or a deed. On the other hand the Pali word kamma means more than simply an action or a deed. Every kamma is preceded by its intent, the volition. The Buddha said, "It is volition (or will - Cetana) which I call kamma. Through volition one performs kamma by means of body, speech and mind." Therefore, kamma is volitional action, a deed done deliberately through body, speech or mind. Every volitional action (except that of a Buddha or of an Arahant) is called Kamma. Thus all actions or deeds are not kamma unless they are first intended; so to say ‘unintended, Involuntary or unconscious actions or deeds do not constitute kamma.

Kamma is not simply a word; Kamma is a law in itself. But it does not mean that there is a lawgiver. Fundamental laws of nature e.g. gravitation, electro-magnetic force etc. need no law-giver. Similarly the law of Kamma has no lawgiver, it is simply universal. It operates in its own universal field without the intervention of an external, any kind of independent ruling agency. Inherent in Kamma is the potentiality of producing its corresponding due effect. The cause produces the effect and in turn the effect explains the cause. The seed produces the fruit and the fruit explains the seed, and both are inter-related. Even so Kamma and its effect are inter-related.

To understand the Doctrine of Kamma, we must first grasp the knowledge of the five Orders or Laws - <strong><em>Niyaamas</em> </strong>which operate in the universe in the physical and mental realms.

(i) <strong><em>Utu niyaamas</em></strong>: Physical inorganic order; e.g., the seasonal phenomena of winds and rains, the unerring order of seasons, characteristic seasonal changes and events, the causes of wind and rains, the nature of heat etc.

(ii) <strong><em>Bija niyaamas</em></strong>: Physical organic order; order of, germs and seeds; e.g., rice produced from rice seed, sugar taste resulting from sugar-cane or honey, the peculiar characteristics of certain fruits, etc. The scientific theory of cells and genes and the physical similarity of twins may be ascribed to this order.

(iii) <strong><em>Kamma niyaamas</em></strong>: Order of act and result; e.g., desirable and undesirable acts produce corresponding good and bad results. As surely as water seeks its own level, so does Kamma, given opportunity, produce its inevitable result - not in the form of reward or punishment but as an innate sequence. This sequence of deed and effect is as natural and necessary as the way of the sun and the moon.

(iv) <strong><em>Dhamma niyaamas</em></strong>: Order of the norm; e.g., the natural phenomena occurring at the advent of a Bodhisatta in his last birth. Gravitation and other similar laws of nature, the reason for being good, and so forth, may be included in this group.

(v) <strong><em>Citta niyaamas</em></strong>: order of mind or psychic law; e.g., processes of consciousness, arising and perishing of consciousness, constituents of consciousness, power of mind, etc. Telepathy, telesthesia, retro-cognition, premonition, clairvoyance, clairaudience and thought-reading all psychic phenomena which are inexplicable to modern science are included in this class.

Kamma is a vast subject. According to the Visuddhimagga, if you understand kamma, you go beyond all doubts and understand the whole doctrine. In my effort to understand this doctrine, I am exploring all possible sources to crystalize its meaning. This small article is in the series of the discussions on this topic. Many more such articles will be shared in due course. I earnestly invite you to enlighten me with your insight by sharing your ideas and knowledge related with the subject. Please, enrich me with your valuable comments; these are going to be the nectar in the process this discussion, the outcome will be the honey of the wisdom of dhamma, to be cherished by us all.
