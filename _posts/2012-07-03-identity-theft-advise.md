Here is some advice from the Theft Resource Center to help keep a lock on your identity during the holiday season.

1. Use a Credit Card, not a debit card, to make purchases. It’s easier to get a fraudulent credit card charge erased than it is to get a bank to restore funds to your bank account.

2. Carry one credit card; leave the rest home “It’s easier to close one credit card than it is to close six, and it’s less damaging in the long run”

3. Be aware of your surroundings. If you’re opening a new credit account, don’t do it at a register or counter where strangers can overhear you or the clerk talking about your information.

4. Watch for people looking at your credit card as it’s being passed to or from the clerk.

5. Watch your card every moment that the clerk has it so it’s not “skimmed” by a dishonest store employee.

6. Put your credit receipt in your wallet or purse, not in the bag with the item.

7. Most credit card receipts are truncated, but the last thing you want is somebody to do a quick drip (in your bag), and they’ve got it.
