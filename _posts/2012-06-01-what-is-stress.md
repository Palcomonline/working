Stress is the effect of our refusal to accept a circumstance in our life for which we have no control. Stress is the measure by the amount of energy that we spend while resisting those circumstances. Stress is also to waste energy with our thoughts and feelings in attempting to change a person, an event or a circumstance around us for changing them according to our wishes and fancies. The only way to avoid stress is to realize that no amount of effort can ever change the circumstances while they are happening to us, no matter how bad, we can avoid stress by not opposing the moment and instead accepting them.
