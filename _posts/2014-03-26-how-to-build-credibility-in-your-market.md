No matter what niche or market that you may be in, building credibility is extremely important for your business.

People want to buy from somebody who knows what he or she is talking about.

Let's face it, would you ever get plastic surgery from a person who doesn't have a real degree? This is a very useless question to ask, but it's very similar to the way your business works online.

Whether you want to sell Amazon products or ebooks in the dating niche, you need to make sure that you classify yourself as an authority on the subject. 

How to build credibility in your market 

Share, Share, Share

Yes, whether it's via a blog post or Facebook update. People want to know you're a real person and that you're genuine. Share your knowledge as much as possible and you'll instantly build your credibility.

Offer email support

If you have a website that details almost everything on a certain niche, then you need to try offering email support of some kind.

There are many people who only offer regular advice on their sites like articles, and by offering free email support, you can show your visitors that you know everything about your sites topic. 

Offer Webinars 

Webinars are basically online streaming events where you can connect with around 1,000 people who will be watching you on your webcam live.

You can talk about your niche, how to succeed in that niche, and everything that you know that your customers will like to know.

This will help show your visitors that you're an expert, helping you to build your credibility tremendously. I highly suggest that you do these webinars, as they are very easy to do, and can provide for you a good amount of credibility on the topic. 

Building credibility is all about showing your customers that you're as real as you can be. Let them know that you know everything that there needs to know about that topic. By offering FREE email support and webinars, you can upsell to them in the future, showing them that you know how powerful that speciic ebook or training is for them.
