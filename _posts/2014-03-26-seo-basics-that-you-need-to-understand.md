Understanding SEO basics is vital to ensure that you know how the search engines like Google and Yahoo Search work.

When you know how they work, you'll be able to get your websites, web 2.0 webpages, and all sorts of articles online ranking high on Google.

One of the first things you need to know is that Google ranks websites based on what they scan through whenever they visit a site.

So, if they see a website that has the word "get rid of pimples today" all over the site, Google will basically try to put that website on the search engines for that specific keyword.

This is to ensure that those who want help or information in this area will see your article, as Google only wants to help people find what they really need. 

Of course, even if your site says all of the keywords over and over again, if there aren't any backlinks generated for the site, you won't see the site climbing up the rankings. This is called off-page optimization.

You need to make sure that you have other websites linking back to your site. Google only wants to rank high quality, authority level websites that are popular online.

How do you get your site to be popular and authority level in Google's eye? By having other sites linking back to yours.

This can be done by leaving your URL on other blog networks, leaving your URL on Yahoo Answers, writing articles online and putting your URL at the bottom, along with many other kinds of ways. 

In addition, you need to make sure your page is optimized for search engines. This is called on-page optimization. Your web page title, description, and keywords should include your main keywords/key phrases you're targeting.

Now that you know how it works, start broadening your understanding on the topic of SEO. Continue to learn how to use SEO tactics into your marketing, and don't be afraid to make mistakes if ever your site doesn't rank high right away.
