<p style="text-align: justify;">Gautam Buddha once said everything that is happening to us at this moment is a result of the karma we have accumulated in the past. All our karma are the choices that we make, whenever we do any karma. Whether we agree or not, most of us make these choices unconsciously, and therefore we don’t even think that they are our choices but they are our choices. Let us examine it with the help of an example. Let us assume that I were to compliment you for your dress, you would most likely make the choice of being pleased. You would in all likelihood feel being pleased or flattered. This decision of being flattered is a choice which you make. Let us get deeper into it. Now in this example, you could have made a choice of not being flattered. But the question is why it happens. It happens as a result of our being bundles of conditioned responses that are constantly being triggered by people and events of circumstances into predictable outcomes of behavior. As a result of conditioning, most of us, have predictable responses to any stimuli in our environment. Our reactions are automatically triggered by people and events of circumstances. Here our responses are not the problems, but the problem is that we forget that these are still our choices that we are making in every moment of our existence. We simply keep making these choices unconsciously all the time throughout our lives.

Vipassana meditation teaches to be able to observe all the events occurring inside our body. And once we extend our meditative practice into our daily lives we would be able to step back for a moment and witness the choices we are about to make, then in just this act of witnessing, we take the whole process from the unconscious realm into the conscious realm. Through this process of conscious choice-making and witnessing empowers us to take complete charge of what all we do. There is only one choice, out of the infinite number of choices that are available in every moment that will create happiness for us as well as for those around us. And when we make that one choice, it will result in a form of behavior that we can call spontaneous right response. It is the right response to every situation as it happens. It is the action that nourishes us and everyone else who is influenced by that action.

Once we get rid of our habit of automated response to the environmental stimuli through the practice of Vipassana meditation and mindfulness, we face the next hurdle of how to make the right choices out of infinity of choices from moment to moment. There is a very precise method that the universe has to help us make spontaneously right choices. This method is based on the sensations in our body. When we face any situation which calls for a choice making, our body experiences two kinds of sensations: one is of comfort, the other is of discomfort. When we want to consciously make a choice, we should pay attention to the feeling of sensations occurring in our body and ask, ourselves how it feels. On such self-referral our body sends a message of comfort that is the right choice. If on the other hand our body sends a message of discomfort, then it is not the right choice. The message of comfort and discomfort may happen in the area of the solar plexus, or it may happen in the area of the heart. As a practice, if we consciously put our attention in the heart and ask our heart what to do and wait for the response in the form of a sensation. It may come as the faintest sensation, but it will be there for sure, in the body. Here, the Vipassana practice comes as a blessing, through this practice we develop ability of observing all the sensations in the body however faintest it may be. While self-referring we get to our heart because it is intuitive as compared to mind; it is holistic, contextual and is relational. It doesn’t act on the basis of a win-lose orientation. It is because it taps into the cosmic computer, the field of pure potentiality, pure knowledge, and infinite power and takes everything into account. Many times the choice may not even seem rational, but the heart has a computing ability that is far more accurate, powerful and far more precise than anything within the limits of our rational thought.</p>
