The new year just started and there is nothing like being able to set new goals. However, a majority of people will hit mid-February and realize that their drive for success has died and the rest of the year seems to simmer down.

Though this is normal for most people, this is something that is NOT seen with successful people. In order to truly learn how to achieve your goals this year, you will need to do two things to ensure that things get done.

Make A Video and Post It

Write down your goals and grab your camera. There is nothing like making promises to other people and having the fear of letting them down.

Whether it is losing weight or trying to get that degree, if you let others know about your goal, you will be less likely to get up and quit.

All you need to do is make a short video telling people about what your goals are and how you will be achieving them. The point is not to feel obligated to succeed but to simply not quit.

You will never be able to know what your true potential is if you just quit.

Watch The Video Everyday

You will need to watch this short 30 second video that you made and you need to keep reminding yourself that you have a goal that you want to achieve.

Though watching it everyday can be tough, it is a good idea to watch the video when you are starting to feel down about your goals.

This is a way to remind yourself that you do want to succeed and you will do whatever it takes to achieve them.

If you do these two very simple things, you will be able to breakthrough and finally have a full year of success that will lead to a fulfilling life.
