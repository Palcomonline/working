<p style="text-align: justify;">The universe operates as a dynamic exchange. Nothing in the universe is static; everything flows even though it may seem to be still or static. Life itself is the continuum of consciousness in spiritual sense and it is the continuity of the process of breathing in physical realm. Nature manifests itself only through the flow of continuous evolution. All our experiences in the physical realm by way of touching, smelling, seeing, hearing or tasting; are possible only because we are a part of the continuity called eternity. Our body is in dynamic and constant exchange with the universal body and our mind is dynamically interacting with the cosmic mind. All our energies are reflection of the universal energy. This energy is the life force of each of us; it is the circulation of energies that we call life. Our physical body is the greatest example of the life depending solely on the circulation of blood that energizes the whole body. Receiving can never take place without giving. Giving is only one end of the process of Receiving. Through this process only the whole of nature operates. If we stop the circulation of energy, it is like stopping the circulation of blood in the body. It will only lead to clotting, to decay and then to death. Therefore to sustain life the circulation by way of giving and receiving must continue un-interrupted. Money is a symbol of life energy that we exchange in order to keep wealth, affluence and abundance circulating in our life. We give or receive money as a result of the service that we provide or use in the society. In order to keep this life energy called money coming to us we must keep this energy circulating. If and when we stop the circulation of money or if our only intention to hold on to it, since it is life energy it will stop the circulation and can no longer support life. In our life receiving is the same thing as giving; they are the different aspect of flow of energy in the universe. The more you give, the more it will come back to you, because by giving you are keeping the abundance of the nature circulating in your life. And the return is directly proportionate to the giving that is unconditional and without any expectation. The giving and receiving can be practiced not only in the form of exchanging money but also in other forms as well. In fact there are more opportunities of exchanging non-monetary or non-material items. We have seen this in our social traditions that whenever we meet anybody we exchange wishes, if the other person is elder to us we receive their blessings and if they are younger to us we give them our well-wishes and blessings. We must practice this even without really expressing ourselves, like when we meet any person we can pray for him or her silently in our mind and give them our warm wishes without even interacting with them. The gifts of caring, giving attention, appreciation, love and affection are the most precious gift we can ever give to our fellow beings that never cost us anything. This silent giving of wishes for their happiness, joy and laughter can be very powerful. As long as we are giving we are bound to receive them back in our life in many unexpected forms.</p>
