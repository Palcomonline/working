There are numerous aspects involved in developing an Internet marketing plan. From budget to end goal, website marketing is a long-term process.

It is also detailed process, which is the reason many site owners hire a marketing specialist to help them plan. 

To start, you must think about the major goal of the marketing campaign. Do you want to increase customer loyalty, boost brand awareness or sell products?

A correctly executed Internet marketing strategy can take an e-commerce business to new levels if all steps are geared toward reaching that final goal. 

Your campaign will be limited by your marketing budget. Many website owners start with a small amount of money, gradually increasing the budget to the highest, yet still comfortable level.

An Internet marketing budget can be unlimited, and you may never reach your entire customer base. Stick with what you can afford, and work within your budget's confines. 

Learn about the direct competitors in your niche by searching for your website's keywords.

You will realize that some businesses are more competitive than others. And potential customers who are searching for services or products offered by your company will usually choose highly ranked websites.

Therefore, any site listed above your site is a competitor. Thoroughly research their services and products, and learn their strengths and weaknesses. 

Make any necessary improvements to your website. Remember, a site is similar to a storefront. The more enticing the website's design, the more traffic and sales the business will garner.

Your services and products should not be carbon copies of your competitors, even if you must increase the quality of your items or include extras in your service packages. 

Finally, identify the customer base you want to target, and advertise in places where they frequent. There are even some sites, particularly social networks, that will place business advertisements in front of a certain audiences to which the ads are targeted.
