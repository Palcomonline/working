The ten-day Vipassana course starts with observing the breadth. The Vipassana aims at calming down your mind. Calming down you mind is not an activity, it is a process. In our mundane life, we simply assume to be in control of our mind. It is because we are free and lead our life with our free will and all of our activities are directed and orchestrated by our mind as per our will and decision making ability. But the fact, the reality is just the opposite, and it is realized the moment we start observing the Noble Silence during Vipassana course. As soon as we start to keep quiet, that is, stop talking, we realize that we have indeed stopped talking but the internal chatting in the mind continues. One thought after another keep flashing on the horizon of our mind and we keep wandering from one thought topic to another in a seemingly un-ending process. It is at this moment that we realize that our mind is not in our control, but we are in control of our mind, through the simple process of thinking. This control has to be reversed through Vipassana in first few days, first three days to be precise. To achieve this we need to focus our mind on breathing. The goal of the first three days of observing your breath is to be able to give a very clear directive to your mind, “attend to breathing.” And see the mind follow this directive.

It is not as simple as saying or even understanding this. While trying to do it leads to frustration in the beginning, but gradually over the period of first three days, the student finds an improved sense of self-mastery along with a feeling of well-being, when the student temporarily and briefly gets relieved of the wayward wandering of the mind. This way the one learns to fix one's attention on the natural reality of the ever changing flow of breath as it enters and leaves the nostrils.

As the Vipassana course progresses onward from forth day, the goal changes from simply observing the breath to now having an experiential knowledge in meditation. On the morning of day four, you take a small area of your body, like the triangular area under the nostrils and over the upper lips, and observe all and any kind of sensation in this specific area of the body.

The most important feature of this observing of sensation is to be neutral at all cost and times, to be neutral means, if the sensation feels good, one should not develop a liking or craving for the same or when the sensation feels bad or undesirable, one should not develop even the mildest hatred for the same. Remaining aloof and observing the sensations leads to the understanding of their nature, and developing equanimity by learning not to react to them.

By day five your observation expands to a slow excursion through the entire body and gradually you develop this experiential knowledge of neutral observance into a practice that is in action all the time, so you learn to meditate in public, in private, hungry, not hungry sleepy, awake, happy, sad, anxious, calm, in any state of mind during the day or night. So the Vipassana becomes a part of your nature and this inevitably results in acquiring many virtues like calmness, patience, being in peace with the reality and above all mindfulness.

Here, one point needs to be asked and explained as to why to meditate on the sensations of the body as opposed to any other focus?  There may be many possible answers to this according to one’s understanding, but the primary reason for this relates to the very nature of body sensations. Body sensations are common universally in all human races, are culturally neutral, are non-sectarian, are non-religious, are non-ideological, are always available and are real. Meditating on body sensation means you are meditating on reality, ever-changing and dynamic. It means that you learn to meditate any time of the since body sensations are occurring and are available all the time either as gross sensations or in its mildest and subtle form. It also means that Vipassana can be learnt and practiced by any person having or not having any affiliations in terms of religions, ethnicity and confirming to any ideology.

Another very important logical question is asked as to why not meditate on the content of the mind, because the ultimate goal is to calm your mind, so why not to focus directly on the mind? This question is very legitimate since many forms of meditations do exactly the same. The most simplistic answer to this question is that the mind cannot observe the mind more than the eye can see itself. In other words, just like the figure cannot touch itself, it will take you in a loop if you try to master your mind by observer mind itself. If you try to observe yourself thinking about something, you will think about that something, or if you are lucky you will think about yourself thinking about that something. But you will not be able to empty your mind of thoughts.

We must understand that body and mind are not different from each other. In fact we are mind-body rather than mind and body. Mind and body are the two aspects of a simultaneous, synthesizing and multidimensional reality. Body sensations are the other part of the mind, the other side of the same coin called human being. It is a known fact that for every mental state there is a corresponding physical state and for every physical state there is a specific mental correlate. Through Vipassana you are able to meet yourself as you really are. This is a great insight which can lead us to the highest level of awakening called Nirvana.
