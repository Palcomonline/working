In almost every aspect of life, there will be a fear of failure. Even the greatest of all time in different walks of life have had the fear of failure but the trick is to learn how to use that energy and to turn it into something positive.

If you do not have some sort of fear, then you most likely are not human. This is because humans are wired to have fear but once you are able to turn this fear into energy towards succeeding, you will then start to see the amazing changes in your life.

Depending on what the situation is, when you have a fear of failure, it most likely comes from the fact that you are lacking confidence.

If you are confident in your craft, then you will have less fear of failure. The goal is to have very little fear and to basically try to get as close to "fearless" as possible.

The closer you get to that euphoric state, then you will start to see that life was never too difficult. Once you get into the habit of always fearing failure, you will never open yourself up to ever feeling what success feels like.

You need to realize that every problem has a solution and only time will reveal the answer. If for some reason you do "fail," remember that this is only to test your patience because as cliche as it may sound, things will happen for a reason, no matter how bad things seem.

So you need to be thankful for every moment of your life and to remember that success and failure should be greeted with open arms. When you have this in mind, you will inevitably lose the fear of failure because you know that everything will happen for a reason.
