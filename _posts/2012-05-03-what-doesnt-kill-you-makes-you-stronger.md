What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger. It is true for every living being. Only yesterday we were casually discussing our experiences of facing unprecedented challenges having potential of throwing our lives out of gear. I shared my only experience when I suddenly felt the presence of a strong possibility of death in the middle of life. Even though we all know and acknowledge the fact that death is inevitable, at the same time we live a life full of promises of future with its unlimited dreams. Every such event that leaves you living after a deathly blow certainly makes you stronger forever.

It raises you one step above the life's ladder from where you can look at a bigger horizon of the stage on which life's drama is being played.

I recall a <a href="http://www.ashishchowdhury.com/the-blind-men-and-the-elephant/" title="The blind men and the elephant">Zen story</a> in which different blind people touch an elephant's body parts and describe them as they are able to visualize only that portion of the elephant and not the whole of elephant and a person with vision can see how wrong they all are, just because their vision's horizon is limited, their perception also gets affected.

And the experiences that does not kill you gives you that bigger vision, I think that’s how one becomes stronger after every such event.
