<p class="western">Yes, to comply with the recent FTC ruling (even though I don't have to since this blog is not based in the USA) over bloggers getting paid to write stuff, I offer the following disclosure policy. If you’re reading my blog, you should assume the following:</p>

<ul>
 	<li>
<p class="western">I make money from every post I put on this blog. If I’m not making money from every blog post, then it was an oversight on my part and it will be corrected soon.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p class="western">Every link on this blog is a paid link. If it is not a paid link, then it was an oversight on my part and it will become a paid link soon.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p class="western">Every product I write about on this blog, I get for free. If I didn’t get it for free, then there was a miss-communication with the company that sent it and I will be billing them for the cost so the product becomes free.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p class="western">I make money from every tweet I send out on Twitter. If I didn’t make money on the tweet, then it was an oversight on my part and it will be corrected soon.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p class="western">If you email me, all of the information in your email is mine to do with as I please, such as exploit for financial profit, use as blackmail, or quote on my blog.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p class="western">The T-shirts you see me wear at trade shows. I get paid to wear them. If I didn’t get paid to wear them, then it means I ran out of paid shirts and had to wear a free one. In which case, I will go to the company that gave me the free shirt and ask them to sponsor it.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p class="western">If something on the Net is making a lot of money, you can bet I will be in on it. If I’m not in on it, then it was an oversight on my part and it will be corrected soon.</p>
</li>
 	<li>
<p class="western"><strong>Just because I get paid to blog, tweet, wear T-shirts, etc. does NOT mean I will give you or your company a positive review, blog post or endorsement. As a matter of fact, chances are pretty high that I might slam you.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="western">Hopefully, the above statement clears up any misunderstanding you may have about my blog posts or Twitter tweets. If you have any questions, you can contact me at <a href="http://ashishchowdhury.com/get-in-touch/">get in tough page</a>. Just remember what I said about emails.</p>
