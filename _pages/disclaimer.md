<p class="western">With financial and legality, these advices are of my own thoughts, opinions, and strategies base on my own personal experience. I do no claim to be a professional or a guru. Always research more information about a topic you wish to know about – read other thoughts. Seek professional expert help before acting on my own conclusions or strategies. These tactics written within this blog are of my own and may or may not work for you.</p>
<p class="western">Never assume I owe you any response. I may receive from a few to hundreds of messages per day, even comments. Some I will gladly write back immediately, others will never reply. Try not to take it personally, because chances are it has more to do with my schedule than anything else. If you get upset and nasty about feeling rejected, you will probably ruin any chances you had of befriending me.</p>
<p class="western">Never use anything off my blog, be it writing, images or html code, unless I say otherwise. A trackback to a post may be used in conjunction with a quote from a particular post. Any post which interests you and would like to be added as part of your own content, please trackback. I as a blogger become very attached to my work and don’t usually respond well when others help themselves to it. Copyright is protected by law and in effect the minute something is created, whether the author has a © notice or not.</p>

Each comment will be reviewed that pass WordPress's Akismet. I will not review any comments that are caught by Akismet, even if it is a valid comment.</p>

<p class="western">You are only allowed to have 1 single link within the comments, if there are more than 1 then the comment will be deleted, regardless of relevancy.</p>
<p class="western">If you are inserting a link, please use anchor texts, as long URL will throw off my layout. If I feel that the URL is too long I will remove it with the attribute [link removed]</p>
<p class="western">Anchor Text should be unique and not dull, example:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Click Here</li>
	<li>See My Page</li>
	<li>View Here</li>
</ol>
These anchor texts should not be used as they are poor. Keep anchor texts unique but less than 6 words.
